<h1>Stanford researchers find a quicker,<br>cheaper way to sort isotopes</h1>
<p>
By EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A. Cicero Richard Zare<br>
Professor Richard Zare in his lab.Whether it's the summer<br>
grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on <br>
your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries <br>
special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can <br>
tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance<br>
are from, where they traveled and what happened to them<br>
along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex<br>
and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new<br>
method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

<h1>Chance to dance: Enthusiasts fly to<br> Stanford for dance weekend</h1>
<p>
BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A Cicero Lindy Hop instruction<br>
Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement-but<br>
life in the Standford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos.<br>
The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym<br>
offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the<br>
hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood<br>
and blues fusion.
